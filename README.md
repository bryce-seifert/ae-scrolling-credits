To use:
* Paste all of the desired names under the "Names" column in the Data.csv file. Do not split into multiple columns. Do not delete the header "Names" row.
* Launch scrolling.aep
* Ensure the "Number of Rows" under the Data.csv layer is the number of rows you are expecting. Adjust if needed. (Note: AE does not auto update this value if you save a new version of the .csv and there are *additional* rows)
* Adjust various parameters including Layout, Speed, and Edge Padding in the Effects Controls window of the Settings layer.
* If you need to adjust any character attributes like font or text size, highlight all of the "Names" layers (cyan color) and make changes in the Character window.
* Trim your comp to the amount of time it takes all of the names to scroll through the frame and export!
